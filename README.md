## Programming Languages

* Each algorithm is implemented with the following languages.
* The program was compiled/ built using the same version. 
* All code in each language is made with a profiler for time and memory.

### About

What I'm looking to do here has probably been done a whole bunch of times before but I felt like it was my turn to have an open code archive for data structures and common algorithms. Of course I could have found this anywhere else on the internet but I felt like making my own would really make the concepts stick. So here it is!

I'm hoping to coalesce the many computational ideas I have picked up over the years. Perhaps I will be able to join some new dots and bring the big picture theoretical ideas into the physical realms of code. I'd still love for it to be fun and take an interactive and enjoyable learning experience seriously, so I'll do my best with that as well. Cheers.
