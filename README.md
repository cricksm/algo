# Data Structures & Algorithms Project
#### With Design, Analysis and Implementation

Hello World! What I'm thinking of doing here has probably been done a whole bunch of times before but I felt like it was my turn to have an open code archive for data structures and common algorithms. At the time of writing this introduction, I am just getting started to prep for my technical interviews and I felt like I needed a one-stop shop to review concepts, implementations and logic. Of course I could have found this anywhere else on the internet but I felt like making my own would really make the concepts stick. So here it is!

As a senior undergraduate in computer science, I'm hoping to coalesce the many computational ideas I have picked up over three years learning the gigantic spectrum of computer and information sciences. Perhaps I will be able to join some new dots and bring the big picture theoretical ideas into the physical realms of code. I'd still love for it to be fun and take an interactive and enjoyable learning experience seriously, so I'll do my best with that as well. Cheers
